"give" is an attribute that can be either a [scriptdictionary](../types/scriptdictionary.html) or [string](../types/string.html).

-   If not specified, the object cannot be given objects.
-   If a [scriptdictionary](../types/scriptdictionary.html), the keys of the dictionary specify objects that can be given to this object. The script values specify scripts to run when that object is given.
-   If a [string](../types/string.html), that string is printed whenever an object is given to this object.

See also [useon](useon.html), [giveanything](giveanything.html).
