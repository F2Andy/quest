"firstenter" is a [script](../types/script.html) attribute. It is run the first time that a player enters an object (room), *after* the room description is printed.

Quest keeps track of whether a room has been visited before by checking the value of the [visited](visited.html) attribute.

See also [beforefirstenter](beforefirstenter.html), [enter](enter.html), [visited](visited.html).
