"giveto" is an attribute that can be either a [scriptdictionary](../types/scriptdictionary.html) or [string](../types/string.html).

It is used in the same way as [give](give.html), except that it allows you to define a "give A to B" relationship the other way around - "give" is an attribute defined on object B, whereas "giveto" is defined on object A.

See also [givetoanything](givetoanything.html).
