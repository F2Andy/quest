The "openable" type is defined in CoreTypes.aslx.

It marks the object as [openable](open.html) and [closeable](close.html), and adds "Open" and "Close" to the [displayverbs](displayverbs.html), but it is *not* a container type. It is intended for objects which can be opened and closed but which are not containers, for example windows and doors.
