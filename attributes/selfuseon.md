"selfuseon" is an attribute that can be either a [scriptdictionary](../types/scriptdictionary.html) or [string](../types/string.html).

It is used in the same way as [useon](useon.html), except that it allows you to define a "use A on B" relationship the other way around - "useon" is an attribute defined on object B, whereas "selfuseon" is defined on object A.

See also [selfuseanything](selfuseanything.html).
