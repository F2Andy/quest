The "container\_limited" type is defined in CoreTypes.aslx. It implements a container which can only accept a certain number of objects (via the [maxobjects](maxobjects.html) attribute). If the player tries to add more objects, they are told that the container is full.

The rest of the container functionality is automatically inherited from the [container](container.html) type.
