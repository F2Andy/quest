title: Locked Exits and How to Open them?
---

*You may want to have an exit that you cannot open without a key or other object*

1. Go to the exit you want to lock

2. Tick the **Locked** box:

3. When you do you need to give a NAME for the “lock”:

4. Either write a message or script to explain why:

5. Next add in the object to open the door and write a description:

6. Click on the **Inventory** tab and tick the **Take** box and add a message:

7. Click on the **Use/Give** tab and select **Use (on its own)**:

8. Scroll down the scripts and select **Unlock exit**:

9. Select the **name** you gave for the unlocking:

10. Add in another messages to make it more realistic. I have also added a sound effect:

11. Now when you use the Key in the game it will unlock the door:

12. Of course the game works much better if you use **ONE OBJECT ON ANOTHER OBJECT TO OPEN A DOOR**

13. If you do this you need to choose **Use this on (another object)** to open an exit.

14. Here I have used chewing gum wrapper (OBJECT) on switch box (OBJECT) to unlock lift door (EXIT)
