---

*Here is a way of creating a quiz style situation*

1. I have set up a room with player and keypad and Exit to the “Outside”

2. I then lock the “Outside” exit:

3. I make the keypad into a container which can be opened and closed:

4. I add a **player answers Yes to** script to the **Script to run when opening object**

5. I type in the Yes/No question that they see on the keypad:

6. I put in the answer if they choose “Yes” (the correct answer)

7. I then add the section if they say “No” (the wrong answer)
