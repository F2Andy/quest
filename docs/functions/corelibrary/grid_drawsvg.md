    Grid_DrawSvg (string instance id, string symbol id, int x, int y, int width, int height)

On the custom grid drawing layer, draws the specified SVG file (the symbol id must have been previously loaded using [Grid\_LoadSvg](grid_loadsvg.html). The instance id is arbitrary - if you re-use the same instance id, the existing symbol will be removed.
