"useon" is an attribute that can be either a [scriptdictionary](../types/scriptdictionary.html) or [string](../types/string.html).

-   If not specified, objects cannot be used on this object.
-   If a [scriptdictionary](../types/scriptdictionary.html), the keys of the dictionary specify objects that can be used on this object. The script values specify scripts to run when that object is used.
-   If a [string](../types/string.html), that string is printed whenever an object is used on this object.

See also [give](give.html), [useanything](useanything.html).
