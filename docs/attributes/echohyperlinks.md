"echohyperlinks" is a [boolean](../types/boolean.html) attribute. If set to "true", when the player uses an object hyperlink, the echoed version of the command (shown in the interface as "\>" followed by the generated command text) also includes a hyperlink.

For example if the user clicks an "apple" object and selects "Eat" from the display verbs menu, the echoed command looks like:

     &gt; eat apple

If echohyperlinks is turned on, this echoed command also contains an "apple" hyperlink allowing the user to choose from the display verbs menu there, without having to scroll back up.
