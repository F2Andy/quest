The "container" type is defined in CoreTypes.aslx. It implements an open container by straightforwardly inheriting the [container\_open](container_open.html) type.

By inheriting the "container" type in an object, it becomes by default [openable](open.html) and [closable](close.html). "Open" and "Close" are added as [displayverbs](displayverbs.html).
