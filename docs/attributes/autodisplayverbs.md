title: autodisplayverbs
---

"autodisplayverbs" is a [boolean](../types/boolean.html) attribute. If set to "true", an object's display verbs are dynamically generated by taking the base [displayverbs](displayverbs.html) list and adding any verbs which have been defined for the object. If set to "false", only the base [displayverbs](displayverbs.html) are used, so the object should be manually set to have the relevant display verbs which you want to display.
