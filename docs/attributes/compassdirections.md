"compassdirections" is a [stringlist](../types/stringlist.html) attribute, specifying the names of the compass directions (north, south etc.)

The order is important as this is used to give the correct direction name to the compass buttons in the player interface.

The directions should be listed in this order:

NW, N, NE, W, E, SW, S, SE, Up, Down, In, Out
