The web version of the Quest editor is currently in beta. The following desktop Quest features are currently not implemented in the web version:

-   Walkthrough editor
-   Attributes editor
-   Verb definition editor (you can add custom verbs to objects, but you can't edit the default verb response)
-   "Advanced" section (libraries, templates, dynamic templates, object types, JavaScript)

If you are new to Quest, see the main [tutorial](tutorial/) - the web interface is largely similar to the desktop interface, and any features unsupported by the web version are clearly marked.
