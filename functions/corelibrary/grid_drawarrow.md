    Grid_DrawArrow (string id, int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2, string border, int borderwidth)

On the custom grid drawing layer, draws an arrow of the specified border colour and thickness from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2). The id is arbitrary - if reused, the existing arrow with the same id will be removed.
