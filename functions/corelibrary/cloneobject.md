    CloneObject (object)

Returns an [object](../../types/object.html). Helper function for cloning objects. Clones the object using the [clone](../../functions/clone.html) script command. If the existing object did not have an alias, the new object gets an alias of the old object's name - this means that this function returns an object that looks the same to the player as the original object.
