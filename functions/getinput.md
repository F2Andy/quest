**Note:** This function is deprecated as of Quest 5.2, and unsupported as of Quest 5.4. Use the [get input(script command)](../scripts/get_input.html) script command instead.

    GetInput()

Waits for the user to enter some text at the command prompt. Instead of handling the input as a command, it is returned as the result of the function, as a [string](../types/string.html).
