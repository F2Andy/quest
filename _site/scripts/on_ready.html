<p>Runs the nested script when any callbacks have finished.</p>

<p>For example, when you use an <a href="ask__script_command_.html">ask</a> or <a href="get_input.html">get input</a> script command, Quest will wait for a response from the player and then run the nested scripts from those commands. However, any other scripts at the same level will run immediately. If you don&#39;t want this to happen, use &quot;on ready&quot; to make the script only run after the user has entered a command or responded to the question.</p>

<p>This is used by the Core library so that, for example, a room description is only displayed after any scripts which ask a question in &quot;before enter&quot; have run their nested scripts. This prevents the room description from being displayed while the question is still on-screen.</p>

<p>Generally there should be no need to use this command in your own games, as of course if you want script to run after an &quot;ask&quot;, you can just put it inside the &quot;ask&quot; script block.</p>
