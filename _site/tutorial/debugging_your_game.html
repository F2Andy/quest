<p>As you develop your games, there will be times when things happen which you didn&#39;t expect – usually because you’ve forgotten to set something up, or you&#39;ve made a mistake in one of your script commands.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Quest provides you with the Debugger, which lets you keep an eye on what&#39;s going on inside your game while you&#39;re testing it. When a game is running, you can open the Debugger from the Tools menu, or &quot;View Debugger&quot; from the toolbar.</p>

<p>You can select any object in the game and view its current attributes. Any attributes inherited from a type are shown in grey - there will usually be quite a few of these, as every object implicitly inherits the &quot;defaultobject&quot; type, which includes many default attributes.</p>
