      <h1>Using lockable containers</h1>
      <p>We&#39;ve already covered <a href="using_containers.html">using containers</a>, but what if you don&#39;t want the container to be immediately openable? If it&#39;s part of a puzzle, you may want the player to have a particular &quot;key&quot; object before they can open it. To implement this, you can make the container lockable.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s create a small (and, admittedly, tedious) puzzle - we&#39;re going to put the defibrillator in a locked box. The player must get the key from the kitchen, unlock the box, and then take the defibrillator from the box before they can revive Bob.</p>

<p>Please bear in mind this is probably the most boring puzzle imaginable. It is just an example. Don&#39;t use it as a guide for something that would make your game more exciting - it&#39;s up to you to think of interesting puzzles!</p>

<p>First, set up the objects:</p>

<ul>
<li>  create a &quot;box&quot; object in the lounge. Make it a closed container.</li>
<li>  move the &quot;defibrillator&quot; object to the box (you can click and drag in the tree in the Windows version, or if you&#39;re using the web version you can select the defibrillator and then click the Move button in the top-right of the screen)</li>
<li>  in the kitchen, add a &quot;key&quot; object, and make it takeable.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, make the box lockable. Go to the Container tab and in the &quot;Locking&quot; section, choose &quot;Lockable&quot; from the lock types list. This will display the lock options. You can now choose the &quot;key&quot; object from the list.</p>

<p>By default we have the &quot;Automatically unlock if player has the key&quot; and &quot;Automatically open when unlocked&quot; options turned on. This is out of politeness to players really, as there&#39;s no need to force them to jump through hoops and perform additional steps - if they&#39;ve unlocked the object, it&#39;s a fair bet they want to open it, and if they type &quot;open box&quot; before unlocking it, then if they have the key, there&#39;s no point in forcing them to type &quot;unlock box&quot; first.</p>

<p>It might be a good idea to tick the &quot;List children when object is looked at or opened&quot; option, in the main Container options. Now your game output will look like something this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text"> &gt; open box
 It is locked.

 &gt; unlock box
 You do not have the key.

 &gt; s
 You are in a kitchen.
 [rest of kitchen description snipped...]

 &gt; take key
 You pick it up.

 &gt; n
 You are in a lounge.
 [rest of lounge description snipped...]

 &gt; unlock box
 Unlocked.
 You open it.
 It contains a defibrillator.
