      <h1>Using lockable exits</h1>
      <h2>Creating the exit</h2>

<p>You can create an exit which is impassable until something else happens in your game. This could be a locked door, or perhaps something like a guard blocking the way.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s create a locked door in the kitchen, leading to a back garden. Create the following three elements:</p>

<ul>
<li>  a new room, &quot;garden&quot;</li>
<li>  an object in the kitchen, &quot;door&quot;</li>
<li>  an exit leading south from the kitchen to the garden</li>
</ul>

<p>Select &quot;Exit: garden&quot; in the tree and tick the &quot;Locked&quot; box. You should see a warning message that we need to give the exit a name. This is because, to unlock the exit during the game, we will need to use a script command. The script command will need some way of referring to this particular exit, which is why we need to give it a name here. Call it something like &quot;garden exit&quot;.</p>

<h2>Unlocking the exit with a script</h2>

<p>Go to the door object, and on the Verbs tab add a verb &quot;unlock&quot;. Set it to &quot;Run a script&quot;, and then add a command to print a message (such as &quot;You unlock you door&quot;). Add an &quot;unlock exit&quot; command, and choose &quot;garden exit&quot; from the list.</p>

<p>Run the game and verify that the exit now works correctly:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text"> &gt; south
 That way is locked.

 &gt; unlock door
 You unlock the door.

 &gt; south
 You are in a garden.
 You can go north.
