      <h1>Changing the player object</h1>
      <p>When you create a Quest game, there is by default one &quot;player&quot; object, which represents the player&#39;s point of view (POV). The player&#39;s inventory consists of all the objects that are contained by this &quot;player&quot; object.</p>

<p>As of Quest 5.3, you can now switch the POV at any time - your game remains a single-player experience, but that player can now switch between different characters. This means you could create a game where the player can explore from different points of view, or perhaps simply choose a pre-defined character when starting the game.</p>

<p>Any script can change the current POV by calling the &quot;Change player object&quot; command. So you could change the POV after asking a question in the game start script, in response to a command, or maybe after successfully solving a puzzle.</p>

<p>Each player object gets its own inventory and attributes. This includes status attributes, so each player could have their own health or stats, and these will be updated on-screen as the player switches between characters. For status attributes which apply across the entire game (perhaps &quot;score&quot; for example), you should set these on the &quot;game&quot; object itself, so they will apply all the time regardless of which object is the current POV.</p>

<p>Objects can behave differently depending on whether they are the player or not. For example, if you have two player objects &quot;Dave&quot; and &quot;Bob&quot; in a game, and it is possible for them to be together in the same room at the same time, you will want different responses for &quot;look at Dave&quot; and &quot;look at Bob&quot; depending on whether the player is currently Dave or Bob.</p>

<p>To handle this, go to the object&#39;s Options tab and look at the &quot;Player&quot; section. If &quot;Can be a player&quot; is selected, options appear where you can set an override &quot;look at&quot; description to display when this object is the player.</p>
