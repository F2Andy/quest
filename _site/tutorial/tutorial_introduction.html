      <h1>Tutorial Introduction</h1>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Quest is a program for writing text adventure games and gamebooks (both of which are sometimes referred to as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction">Interactive Fiction</a>).</p>

<p>There are two versions:</p>

<ul>
<li>  a <a href="http://www.textadventures.co.uk/create/">web version</a> which runs entirely in your web browser (Chrome, FireFox, Internet Explorer, Safari), without downloading any software.</li>
<li>  a <a href="http://www.textadventures.co.uk/quest/download">Windows version</a>, downloadable for Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows Vista or Windows XP</li>
</ul>

<p>This tutorial applies to both versions. Both versions are fundamentally the same, although the Windows version of the game editor has a few more features.</p>

<h2>What is a text adventure?</h2>

<p>Text adventure games were the earliest type of computer game, from a time when computers could only display text - there were no graphics, so everything was described with text. You would play the game by typing commands with the keyboard such as &quot;go north&quot; or &quot;hit troll&quot;. Quest lets you make this kind of game - you can include graphics now though, and play the game by clicking hyperlinks instead of having to type everything.</p>

<h2>What is a gamebook?</h2>

<p>A gamebook is a book that you don&#39;t read from beginning to end - instead, you make choices as you go along. In a physical book, you would be asked to turn to different pages for different choices. Examples include the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure">Choose Your Own Adventure</a> books. Quest lets you make this kind of game, where clicking hyperlinks takes the player to the different pages.</p>

<h2>Why create text adventures and gamebooks now?</h2>

<p>Here are some reasons why interactive text games are great:</p>

<p>Interactive text games are easy to create<br>
You don&#39;t need to have a team of people creating graphics, music and sound effects. You don&#39;t even need any programming experience. If you&#39;ve never created a game before, a text game is the easiest and quickest way to start. This doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s trivial - creating a good game, like creating a good novel, takes a lot of effort - but you don&#39;t need to have any special tools or expertise to start.</p>

<p>Interactive text games are accessible<br>
You don&#39;t need fast reactions to play a text-based game. In fact, you don&#39;t even need to be able to see - text-based games are one of the few types of games that the visually impaired can enjoy, using a screen reader to speak the text aloud. You don&#39;t need to have a particular type of computer - you can play a text game using nothing more than a web browser. All of this means that a text game can be played by just about anybody.</p>

<p>Using Quest, you can play and create text-based games, which can include pictures, sounds and video. To play some games which people have created already, see <a href="http://www.textadventures.co.uk/">textadventures.co.uk</a>.</p>

<p>If you have some time to spare, it&#39;s well worth watching the documentary <a href="http://www.getlamp.com/">Get Lamp</a> (also on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRhbcDzbGSU">YouTube</a>) - it&#39;s a brilliant telling of the history of text adventure games.</p>

<h2>Programming without Programming</h2>

<p>Quest is a powerful system with a gentle learning curve - you can get started very easily without doing any programming at all, and build up from there. The point and click editor means there&#39;s no need to remember syntax, type in strange punctuation or even remember commands. But there is a lot of power underneath - a full programming language in fact. You never need to see any code to access the full power of Quest, but the Windows version includes a &quot;Code View&quot; feature so it&#39;s there if you need it.</p>
