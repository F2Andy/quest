      <h1>Interacting with objects</h1>
      <h2>Object Types</h2>

<p>An object&#39;s &quot;Setup&quot; tab lets you choose the type of object. Select the &quot;TV&quot; object we created in the last section.</p>

<p>The first &quot;Type&quot; dropdown at the top of the screen lets you select from:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Room</li>
<li>  Object</li>
<li>  Object and/or room</li>
</ul>

<p>Rooms and objects are really the same thing in Quest - the option you select here simply lets the editor show you only what&#39;s relevant for the current object. If you wanted to create a cupboard inside a room that the player could get in, you might want to select &quot;object and/or room&quot; here - but in this tutorial, just leave this option set to the default.</p>

<p>The second &quot;Type&quot; dropdown lets you select from the following types:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Inanimate object</li>
<li>  Male character</li>
<li>  Female character</li>
<li>  Inanimate objects (plural)</li>
<li>  Male characters (plural)</li>
<li>  Female characters (plural)</li>
</ul>

<p>Whichever type you select, the object will behave in pretty much the same way, except that Quest&#39;s default responses will make a lot more sense if you set this correctly. This is because setting the type will update the Gender and Article (you can also override these manually).</p>

<ul>
<li>  <strong>Gender</strong>: Usually &quot;it&quot;, &quot;he&quot;, &quot;she&quot; or &quot;they&quot;. Quest uses this for sentences such as &quot;<em>It</em> is closed&quot;, &quot;<em>He</em> says nothing&quot; and so on.</li>
<li>  <strong>Article</strong>: Usually &quot;it&quot;, &quot;him&quot;, &quot;her&quot; or &quot;them&quot;. Quest uses this for sentences such as &quot;You pick <em>it</em> up&quot;, &quot;You can&#39;t move <em>her</em>&quot; and so on.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Scenery</h2>

<p>The &quot;Scenery&quot; option means that the object won&#39;t be displayed automatically in the room description, or the &quot;Places and Objects&quot; on the right of the screen.</p>

<p>Why might we want to do this? Well, when we created our &quot;lounge&quot; description in the previous section, we wrote &quot;This is quite a plain lounge with an old beige carpet and peeling wallpaper&quot;. What if the player types &quot;look at wallpaper&quot;? Quest will reply &quot;I can&#39;t see that here&quot;, which will be a bit strange.</p>

<p>Although the wallpaper isn&#39;t an important object, we should still have a response for &quot;look at wallpaper&quot;. If we make it a scenery object, it&#39;s &quot;in the background&quot; as far as the game goes, as it won&#39;t appear in the &quot;Places and Objects&quot; list, or in the list of objects in the description of the room. We won&#39;t be cluttering things unnecessarily, but we will still be providing responses for anything the player might reasonably type in.</p>

<p>So, create a new object called &quot;wallpaper&quot; and tick the Scenery box. Enter a description like &quot;The horrible beige wallpaper hangs loosely on the walls.&quot;</p>

<p>Launch the game and verify that although the wallpaper doesn&#39;t explicitly appear in the description, you can still get a sensible response by typing &quot;look at wallpaper&quot;.</p>

<h2>Exercise</h2>

<p>Remember that we also mentioned the carpet in the room description as well. As an exercise, add this as another scenery object, and give it a sensible description.</p>

<h2>Creating a Character</h2>

<p>Let&#39;s create our first character. He&#39;ll be about as basic a character as you can get, and he won&#39;t be the most talkative. This is because he&#39;s dead. Well, you&#39;ve got to start somewhere.</p>

<p>Create a new object called &quot;Bob&quot; and change his type to &quot;Male character&quot;. Give him a &quot;look&quot; description of &quot;Bob is lying on the floor, a lot more still than usual.&quot;</p>

<p>There is one other thing we need to do. If you run the game now, you&#39;ll see the room description says &quot;You can see a TV, a sofa and <em>a</em> Bob&quot;. There&#39;s only one Bob - well, in this game anyway - so we want to get rid of that &quot;a&quot;. Where did that even come from? The answer is the prefix.</p>

<h2>Prefix and Suffix</h2>

<p>A prefix and a suffix let you insert text before and after the object name when it&#39;s displayed in a room description. When you leave &quot;Use default prefix and suffix&quot; checked, the suffix is blank, and the prefix (for English games) is either &quot;a&quot; or &quot;an&quot; depending on whether the object name (or alias) begins with a vowel.</p>

<p>You can specify your own text by unchecking the box. Two new textboxes will appear, and for our &quot;Bob&quot; character you can just leave them blank, as we don&#39;t want any text added around our object name.</p>

<p>A quicker way of doing this is to select &quot;Male character (named)&quot; from the types list.</p>

<p>We will come back to Bob later in the tutorial, where will make him a little more animated.</p>

<h2>Taking the newspaper</h2>

<p>You should have added a newspaper object as an exercise at the end of the previous section. If you didn&#39;t, add one now. We&#39;re going to make this an object that the player can take.</p>

<p>This is very easy to do - simply go to the &quot;Inventory&quot; tab. You have a couple of different options for &quot;Take&quot;:</p>

<p>Default behaviour: You&#39;ll want to use this for most of your take-able objects. This option gives you the &quot;Object can be taken&quot; checkbox, and the ability to specify a &quot;take message&quot; which is printed when the player takes (or attempts to take) the object.
Run script: If you want full control over what happens when the player attempts to take the object, choose this option. We will cover scripts later on in the tutorial, so don&#39;t choose this for now.  </p>

<p>To let the player take the newspaper, we just need to tick the &quot;Object can be taken&quot; box. If you don&#39;t specify a message, you&#39;ll get a default message - &quot;You pick it up&quot;. If you want something a bit more imaginative, you can enter a Take Message such as &quot;You fold the newspaper and place it neatly under your arm&quot;.</p>

<p><img src="Takedrop.png" alt="" title="Takedrop.png"></p>

<p>The &quot;Object can be dropped&quot; box is ticked by default, so the player can take and drop the object as many times as they like. The options are the same as for &quot;Take&quot;, so you can specify your own drop message or completely customise the behaviour with a script if you like.</p>

<h2>Switching the TV on and off</h2>

<p>Let&#39;s make it possible to turn the TV off. To do this, select the TV and go to the Options tab. You&#39;ll see a dropdown labelled &quot;Switchable&quot; - select &quot;Can be switched on/off&quot; and various options will appear.</p>

<p>The options should be fairly self-explanatory - you can choose whether the object is switched on when the game begins, and the text to print when switching on/off. Finally, you can choose some extra text to add to the object description. This lets you have show text depending on whether the object is switched on or off.</p>

<p>Enter some sensible text for these, for example as shown below.</p>

<p><img src="Switchonoff.png" alt="" title="Switchonoff.png"></p>

<p>Go back to the Setup tab and change the &quot;Look at&quot; description so it just reads &quot;The TV is an old model, possibly 20 years old.&quot;</p>

<p>Now when you play the game, you get sensible behaviour for &quot;switch on tv&quot;, &quot;switch off tv&quot;, and alternative forms of the command.</p>

<p><img src="Switchonoffplay.png" alt="" title="Switchonoffplay.png"></p>

<p>Notice that by setting this object up as &quot;Can be switched on/off&quot;, two new options &quot;switch on&quot; and &quot;switch off&quot; have automatically appeared in the TV hyperlink menu.</p>

<h2>Exercise</h2>

<p>Add a &quot;switchable&quot; lamp to the lounge that is switched on at the start of the game.</p>
