      <h1>Multiple choices - using a switch script</h1>
      <p>A &quot;switch&quot; is like an &quot;if&quot; script, but it caters for more options without you having to to add a load of &quot;else if&quot; entries.</p>

<p>In this example, we&#39;ll add a telephone to the lounge and set up a &quot;dial&quot; command. The player will be able to dial a variety of different numbers:</p>

<ul>
<li>  999 will print the message &quot;There&#39;s no need to call the police now.&quot;</li>
<li>  94672 will print the message &quot;Madame Buxom, Queen of Pain, is on her way.&quot;</li>
<li>  32461 will print the message &quot;A voice at the end of the line says &#39;Stop calling this number you pervert!&#39;&quot;</li>
<li>  15629 will print the message &quot;Youâ€™re not hungry or drunk enough for anything from Luigi&#39;s Pizza Palace right now.&quot;</li>
<li>  Otherwise &quot;Sorry, wrong number!&quot; will be printed</li>
</ul>

<p>First, add a telephone to the lounge and give it a sensible description. You should also go to the Object tab and give it an &quot;Other name&quot; of &quot;phone&quot;. Next, add a command &quot;dial #text#&quot;. Whenever the player types &quot;dial&quot;, the text that follows will be put into the &quot;text&quot; string variable.</p>

<p>In the command script, add &quot;switch&quot;. You can now enter a Switch expression, and any number of cases. Here, we want to compare the variable &quot;text&quot; against different values, so the Switch expression is &quot;text&quot;. Each of the cases that we add will be compared against this.</p>

<p>Click Add to add the first case. Enter the expression &quot;999&quot;.</p>

<p>Click OK. The Script Editor will now be displayed, ready for you to enter the script that should run if #text# is equal to &quot;999&quot;. Print the message &quot;There&#39;s no need to call the police now.&quot; and close the window.</p>

<p>Follow the same process to enter the responses for the other phone numbers. When you reach the bottom of the list, add script to the &quot;Default&quot; section to print &quot;Sorry, wrong number!&quot;. This will handle any other input that wasn&#39;t matched by our cases.</p>

<p>When you have finished, the Script Editor should look like this:</p>

<p><img src="Switch.png" alt="" title="Switch.png"></p>

<p>This is much easier to read, edit and add to than if we had used lots of &quot;if&quot; and &quot;else if&quot; scripts.</p>

<p>Launch the game and dial a few numbers to check that you see the correct response.</p>
