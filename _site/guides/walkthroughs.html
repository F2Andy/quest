      <h1>Walkthroughs</h1>
      <p>You can specify a walkthrough to let you automatically test your game.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text"> &lt;walkthrough name=&quot;main&quot;&gt;
   &lt;steps&gt;
     look at thing
     take thing
     drop thing
     go east
     speak to guard
     give watch to guard
   &lt;steps&gt;
 &lt;walkthrough&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p>You can then run the walkthrough by clicking Tools, Walkthrough.</p>

<p>Walkthroughs can share steps - useful if you want to test multiple &quot;branches&quot; of your game. You can set up a hierarchy of walkthroughs. When you run a walkthrough, any steps in its parent(s) are also run.</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text"> &lt;walkthrough name=&quot;root&quot;&gt;
   &lt;steps&gt;
     east
     look at poison
   &lt;steps&gt;
   &lt;walkthrough name=&quot;death&quot;&gt;
      &lt;steps&gt;
         eat poison
      &lt;/steps&gt;
   &lt;/walkthrough&gt;
   &lt;walkthrough name=&quot;life&quot;&gt;
      &lt;steps&gt;
         give poison to Jack the Ripper
      &lt;/steps&gt;
   &lt;/walkthrough&gt;
 &lt;walkthrough&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here we have two walkthroughs &quot;life&quot; and &quot;death&quot; which descend from a common &quot;root&quot; walkthrough. Running the &quot;death&quot; walkthrough will run the sequence &quot;east/look at poison/eat poison&quot; while running &quot;life&quot; runs &quot;east/look at poison/give poison to Jack the Ripper&quot;.</p>

<h2>Handling menus and questions</h2>

<p>You can add a menu selection to a walkthrough by preceding it with &quot;menu:&quot;</p>

<p>For example if you have two objects &quot;potato&quot; and &quot;potassium&quot;, you can put this in the walkthrough:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text"> take pot
 menu:potato
</code></pre></div>
<p>You can also add an answer to a question by preceding it with &quot;answer:&quot;</p>

<p>For example if somebody asks you a question when you speak to them, put this in the walkthrough:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text"> speak to Bill
 answer:yes
</code></pre></div>
<p>If you forget to put in these two statements, the walkthrough will immediately stop.</p>

<h2>Assertions</h2>

<p>As of Quest 5.1, you can use walkthrough assertions to test your game. Simply include a line starting with &quot;assert:&quot;, and then any expression which should be true.</p>

<p>For example, in the walkthrough below, the assert expression checks that the &quot;take biscuit&quot; command succeeded:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text"> &lt;walkthrough name=&quot;main&quot;&gt;
   &lt;steps&gt;
     look at tin
     open tin
     look at biscuit
     take biscuit
     assert:biscuit.parent = player
   &lt;steps&gt;
 &lt;walkthrough&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p>If a walkthrough assert expression returns false, the walkthrough is immediately stopped.</p>

<h2>Record</h2>

<p>The easiest way to create a walk-through is to click the record button, and then just do in game what you want in the walk-through. What is particularly neat is that you can click record for an existing walk-through, and Quest will get you to the end of that, and then record after that, adding your new actions to the end of the old walk-through.</p>
