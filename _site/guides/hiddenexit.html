      <h1>Hiddenexit</h1>
      <p>You have a number of options with regards to how Quest handles your exit. Create it normally, then tick the boxes as appropriate. Remember that if you want to change the value of any of these, you need to give the exit a unique name.</p>

<h2>Locked</h2>

<p>An exit that is locked will be visible to the player, but he will be unable to use it. It will get listed as normal and will appear in the compass rose as an exit.</p>

<h2>Scenery</h2>

<p>In contrast, an exit that is flagged as scenery will not be visible to the player, but he will be able to use it.</p>

<p>This is useful if you want to allow the player two options to get to another room. Perhaps he is in a hut with a single door, he could type OUT or EAST to leave the hut; the result is the same - there is only one door here. It would be better to flag one exit as scenery, so the compass rose accurately reflects the situation, with just one exit shown.</p>

<h2>Visible</h2>

<p>Exits are visible by default. An exit that is not visible cannot be seen, and cannot be used.</p>

<p>Having an invisible exit can be useful for situations where the map is changing. A landslide has opened up a new route, for example; this can be handled by changing the exit from not visible to visible.</p>
