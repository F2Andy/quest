<p>&#39;&#39;In my groups quest game, we have Machinery that you have to switch off in order to get a golden ticket. However at the moment you just click take and you will get it. What we want to do is that if you don&#39;t switch off the Machinery first you cut yourself and die, but if you do switch it off you can get the golden ticket. &#39;&#39;</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I have created an Engine room with machinery and inside the machinery is the golden ticket.</p>

<p>[[File:hskeyinside1.jpg]]</p></li>
<li><p>I have made the machine a switch in <strong>Options</strong> and kept it switched on at the start:</p>

<p>[[File:hskeyinside2.jpg]]</p></li>
<li><p>I added in a message when you switch off the machine:</p>

<p>[[File:hskeyinside3.jpg]]</p></li>
<li><p>I have added a Script to the <strong>Description</strong> of the machine so when you look at it, it tells you what it is and plays an engine sound if it is switched on:</p>

<li><p>For the Golden Ticket I changed the Take command and made an IF command:</p>

<p>[[File:hskeyinside5.jpg]]</p></li>
<li><p>The first part says if the machine is switched on then you get lots of messages including a scream as your arm is cut off and you die!</p>

<p>[[File:hskeyinside5.jpg]]</p></li>
<li><p>The second part says if the object is switched off then you safely get the ticket.</p>

<p>[[File:hskeyinside7.jpg]]</p></li>
<li><p>I added a script that automatically moves the ticket to the Inventory by moving the ticked to the player</p>
