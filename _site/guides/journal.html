      <p>This is easy to set up. Create a suitably named object (add it to the player so he starts with it in the inventory), and set its description to run a script. In the script, select Print, then expression, and for the expression type something like this: &quot;You open your journal and try to decipher your notes. <i>&quot; + player.jottings + &quot;</i>&quot;</p>

<p>Next, create a new attribute for the player. Call this &quot;jottings&quot; and set it as a string.</p>

<p>Now whenever something salient happens, include a script that will set a variable, and set the variable player.jottings to the expression player.jottings + &quot; Something interesting happened.&quot;</p>

<p>If you want, you can let the player add comments too. Go to the Use section of the inventory tab for the journal, and set it for a script. There are three steps to the script. The first is to print a message telling the user to type some content. The next step is to set a variable. Call it new_text, and set it to the player_input option from the list. The third step is the same as before; adding the new text to the old. Set the variable player.jottings to the expression player.jottings + &quot; &quot; + new_text.</p>
