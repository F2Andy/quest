      <h1>Hyperlinks</h1>
      <p>Quest uses a kind of HTML (the language of web pages) to display text, and displaying a link is done through that. In fact, there are three different links, and if you set up a room that will print this (set the description to run a script, and have the script print the following as a message) you can see them:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">  Here is some text with an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.textadventures.co.uk/forum/index.php&quot;&gt;anchor link&lt;/a&gt;,
  a link for &lt;object verbs=&quot;Look at/Examine&quot;&gt;me&lt;/object&gt;
  and a link for a &lt;command input=&quot;wait&quot;&gt;command&lt;/command&gt;.
</code></pre></div>
<p>When the room description is displayed, there are three links. Clicking on the first will open up that web page in your browser, and is exactly the same as a link on a web page (so, yes, the HTML tag that lets you move to another web page is a for anchor, a nautical device for keeping you from moving somewhere else).</p>

<p>Click on the third, and Quest gives a choice of verbs, and when one is selected, it is sent as a command. Specifically, the command sent is: <verbselected> <textinlink></p>

<p>In fact, you can put any command together like this; say there is a command that recognises &quot;jump up and down&quot;, this string will give a link to that: Here is some text with a link for <object verbs="Jump up">and down</object>.</p>

<p>However, a better way is using the third type of link. The command link just sends the input attribute to the parser.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> Quest 5.3 is expected to add extra functionality to hyperlinks.</p>

<h2>Related functions</h2>

<p><em>GetTaggedName (object, type, verbs)</em> Gets the name/alias of the object. If type is not the empty string and game.enablehyperlinks then this is wrapped up as a link, using object tags, and the verbs given. This is an internal command, and you are not expected to use it.</p>

<p><em>GetDisplayNameLink (object, type, verbs)</em> Gets the name/alias of the object. If type is not the empty string and game.enablehyperlinks then this is wrapped up as a link, using object tags, and the verbs given, unless the type is &quot;exit&quot;, in which case command tags are used. Prefixes and suffixes are also added as required outside the tags.</p>

<p><em>ObjectLink (object)</em> Uses GetTaggedName for the given object.</p>

<p><em>CommandLink (cmd, text)</em> Creates the text for a command link</p>

<p><em>DisplayMailtoLink (text, email)</em> Creates an email link.</p>

<p><em>DisplayHttpLink (text, url, https)</em> Creates a link to another web page.</p>
