      <h1>Use functions</h1>
      <p>If you want to run the same script from different places, you can use functions. Let us say you have a futuristic city, and the player can teleport between any of several points. Each time he teleports, you want to charge him, and give a little description. The first time, you want to give a longer description, but you do not know which route that will be.</p>

<p>The way to set this up is to have each exit call a function.</p>

<p>To start, right click Object and select &quot;Add Function&quot;; give your function a good name. Like any function in a programming language, you can have parameters and a return value. In the example, the destination is a parameter, so click the parameters &quot;Add&quot; button and type &quot;destination&quot;.</p>

<p>The rest of it is creating a script as normal. The one extra point is that you can reference the parameters as expressions.</p>

<p>Once you have the function set up, you just need to call it. &quot;Call function&quot; is an option under scripts, and when you select it, you can put in your parameters.</p>

<h2>Returning Values</h2>

<p>A function can return a value. You need to specify what type the returned value will be (boolean, string, object, etc.). In the script, you can set the return value by calling the Return function.</p>

<p>Be aware that the script will continue to run even after the Return. The function only sets the result of the function, it does not affect the flow of the script.</p>
