Attribues help to describe an object to the game world and users of Quest, attributes can be added to an [object](types/object.html) and can be of any type supported by Quest.

The game code in Quest, that you write, can interogate these attributes on an object and use this information to make things happen. Things like informing the user with some information or causing other objects to change state like a door unlocking.

See the [Custom attributes](tutorial/custom_attributes.html) tutorial for more information.
