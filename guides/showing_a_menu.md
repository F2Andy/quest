title: Showing a menu

To display a menu, use the [show menu](../scripts/show_menu.html) script command.

First, you need to create a string list of options - see [Using Lists](using_lists.html). Then call the "show menu" command to display the list to the user and run a nested script after the user has made their selection.

Here is an example how to create a menu: First fill a new list with the entries 'female' and 'male'. If the player chooses an entry from the menu the variables playername and gender are set.
