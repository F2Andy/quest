Irritated by “a” in your objects?
=================================

'**'Problem**'

In my game I have an object called Simon Cowell but when I run the game it keeps saying “a Simon Cowell”. How do I change this?

***Answer***

1. Go to the object and Select the Object Tab

2. Click on the Type: drop down and check Male Character

  3. Find the Use default prefix and suffix box and untick it:

4. If you want to be more formal, you can click in the Prefix box and type: Mr

5. The suffix box is for things that come after the person’s name – not sure why you would have it apart from maybe writing (high-rise trousers)

6. When you run the game you get this:

7. If you leave it blank and don’t put in Mr you get:
