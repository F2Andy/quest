Object blocking an exit
=======================

1. I have created the rooms and objects (the mini roll is in the garden and the oompa loompa is in the house)

2. I have written a message when you take the mini roll:

3. I have linked the garden to the House:

4. In the house I click the “**locked**” option and called it MR (you need to give the lock a name)

5. Because you want the door to be opened and the way barred by the oompa loompa you write this message:

6. I click on the mini roll and go to **Use/Give** and **Give (on its own)**

      

7. I write in a message (pretending I have given the chocolate to the oompa loompa) and find the **Unlock exit** command and unlock the door (MR)
