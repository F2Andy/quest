Jumping to a specific page
==========================

With Quest 5.4 it's not possible to show a page preview. Here is a way to jump easily to every page when starting your gamebook.

First set the page type of the starting page to "Script + Text". Then insert the following script:

![](Gbpreview1.png "Gbpreview1.png")     


codeview of the script:

 ![](Gbpreview2.png "Gbpreview2.png") 
 
 
Before publishing the gamebook you can change the page type of the starting page to "Text" again.
