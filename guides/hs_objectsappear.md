title: Making Objects Appear when a Light is Switched On
---

*To make objects appear when a light is turned on and off you need to move them from one room to another and back again*

1. First make up a room that is exactly the same as the original room:

2. Next, put all the objects that were in the original room into the “new” one:

3. In the “old” room add in an object like a switch or sensor:

4. Click on **Options** on the switch/sensor and select **Can be switched on/off**:

5. Add a message when switched on and off:

6. Go to **After switching on the object**: and add in the commands:

7. This moves the objects from Office2 to Office when the light is switched on

8. Go to **After switching off** the object: and add in the commands:

9. This moves the objects back into Office2 to Office when the light is switched off.

10. Click on the Office Room and make up an IF script like this:

11. This writes a message when you go into a room if the switch is off or on:

12. When you play the game you see a touch pad that you can switch on and off:

13. When you press it on the objects are moved into the room:

14. When you switch off, the objects are “removed”:
