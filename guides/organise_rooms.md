title: Organise rooms
---

As your adventure grows, you can end up with a long list of rooms. You can organise them into groups, by having the rooms as child elements of other rooms.

For example, set up a room called object haunted\_house\_region, and move all the rooms inside the haunted house into this room. The room itself has no exits going to it, so the player never sees it. When you are working on the haunted house, expand haunted\_house\_region to see the rooms; otherwise, collapse it, and keep them hidden away.
